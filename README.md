# Finger Counting using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to count the number of fingers shown in the webcam feed using computer vision techniques in Python with OpenCV.

## Features

- Real-time finger counting from the webcam feed.
- Detects skin color in the ROI (Region of Interest) and segments the hand.
- Uses convexity defects to count the number of fingers based on hand contours.
- Displays the detected number of fingers in real time along with the FPS (Frames Per Second).

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Math
